# q.8 The following code keeps looping forever. (You can hit Ctrl-C to stop it.) Why does 
# the loop keep running? Modify it so that it stops after the first iteration.

while True:
    print("and on")
    break

# Adding the 'break' statement after the print statement stops the 'while' loop after the
# first iteration.
